# hello-world

I am a new user on GitHub. I plan to write emulators in the future. One will be a GB emulator that can also play GBC and SGB; this emulator will bring new things to the table. Another will be an SNES emulator. Either I will fork from bsnes-classic, or I will create a new one altogether from scratch.

I will write these emulators in C.

I do have some interest in writing operating systems. To be more independent from Windows and other established brands.
